# MicroShell

Simply shell written in C. Fully working on Linux. Project for Operating Systems classes. Run program and then type "help", then you'll see all avaible commands. The shell also work with standards commands from bash. I wrote my own versions of "cd" command, "wc" command, "mkdir" command and "history" command and "help".
